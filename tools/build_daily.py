"""Build a prebuilt calendar of daily picks for the static site.

Pulls only publicly readable, no-login content from churchofjesuschrist.org:

  * Book of Mormon chapters      -> a daily verse
  * Come, Follow Me weekly pages -> a daily verse from this week's reading
  * General Conference talks     -> a daily quote

The result is written to data/daily.json, which the site reads directly. The

# The hundred passages the Church's seminary programme asks students to know:
# twenty-five from each standard work. They are the settled answer to "which
# verses matter most", arrived at by people whose job was to decide it, so they
# are carried here as a fixed list rather than guessed at by the scoring below.
#
# They matter to this build in two ways. Every one of them is guaranteed a turn
# in the Book of Mormon calendar, spaced through the year; and any of the
# hundred that falls inside a Come, Follow Me week's reading is put into that
# week whether or not the lesson page happens to link it.
#
# Each entry is the chapter's study path and the verses to quote. Non-adjacent
# verses are cited exactly as the mastery list cites them -- "2 Nephi 25:23, 26"
# is that pair and not the four verses between them.

# The study reader does nothing to soften a fragment landing. Its stylesheets
# set no scroll-margin and no scroll-padding, and nothing on the page moves the
# scroll after the browser has jumped. So following #p23 puts verse 23's first
# line flush against the top of the window -- underneath the reader's own
# chapter toolbar, which is drawn over the top of the page. The verse someone
# followed the link to read arrives with its opening line already cut in half.
#
# Only the link is ours to change, and that turns out to be enough, because the
# reader takes `id=` and the fragment as two separate instructions: `id=` says
# what to highlight, the fragment says where to scroll. Its own footnote links
# already use them apart, as `?id=p21#note1_a`. So the fragment is aimed a
# verse or two above the one being quoted, and that earlier text takes the
# toolbar's place at the top of the screen. The highlight lands where it always
# did, on the verse the card actually quoted.
#
# How far above is a compromise between two ways of being wrong: too little and
# the toolbar still clips the verse, too much and the run-up pushes the verse
# off the bottom instead. Both sides of that are measured against one screen of
# the reader, so the screen is what they are written in.
#
# A phone shows about twenty lines of body text between the chapter toolbar
# drawn across the top and the chapter-nav bar across the bottom, and a line
# holds about thirty-four characters: Alma 57:28 is 271 characters and takes
# eight lines of it. Characters stand in for height because lengths are what
# the builder has -- it ignores the gap between paragraphs, worth about half a
# line each, which is why the two limits below are drawn inside the screen
# rather than up against it.

# and still count as having arrived -- enough for the highlight to be visible
# and for the paragraph to have plainly begun.
LANDING_LINES = 3

# So the walk back stops as soon as it has the toolbar covered with a line to
# spare. It is a floor to reach, not a depth to fill: given a choice between a
# cushion that clears the toolbar and a deeper one, the shallower is better,
# because it opens the verse nearer the top of the screen. At six lines this
# was overshooting -- 1 Nephi 3:7 walked past a verse that left it 118
# characters clear to take one that left it 380.
SCROLL_CUSHION = (TOOLBAR_LINES + 1) * LINE

# The far side is where the run-up would push the quoted paragraph off the
# bottom: it may fill the screen down to the last few lines and no further.
# Past that a link gives up and keeps its own anchor, taking the clipping,
# because a verse cut off at the top is at least visibly there.
#
# This is the number that decides how often that giving up happens, and at 400
# it cut straight through the middle of how long a paragraph actually runs.
# Alma 57:26 is 402 characters, so Alma 57:27 was clipped over two characters'
# worth of margin -- along with one link in twenty across the calendar, and a
# fifth of the conference quotes, whose paragraphs are longer than verses.
SCROLL_CEILING = (SCREEN_LINES - LANDING_LINES) * LINE

# A verse can point out of itself in three ways that reading it cold does not
# survive, and this pattern catches two of them. The third -- a pronoun with
# nobody in the verse to mean -- is `unanchored_singular` below, because
# answering it needs to know where the words are and not merely which ones.
#
# The first is a dangling speech attribution: the speaker left behind instead
# of the subject. Job 1:21 reaches the card as "And said, Naked came I out of
# my mother's womb", because the man saying it is back in verse 20. Only an
# attribution naming nobody counts -- "thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
# unto his disciples" says whose words follow, and reads as well cold as
# anything in the book.
#
# The second is a demonstrative standing where the subject goes. Two things
# that only look like it are exempted:
#
#   * the expletive "it is", which stands in for nothing at all ("It is better
#     that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish
#     in unbelief");
#   * a demonstrative used as a determiner, where the subject is still to come
#     and usually turns out to be the speaker: "But this much I can tell you,
#     that if ye do not watch yourselves ... ye must perish", "These things
#     have I written unto you". Only a demonstrative standing alone as the
#     subject is looked at, which is why the test wants a verb after it.
#
# Standing alone, it is still let through when what follows names the thing it
# means, since the verse then says what it is about rather than pointing out of
# itself: "And this is my doctrine", "For behold, this is my church", "This is
# the way; and there is none other way", "And this is life eternal, that they
# might know thee the only true God". What is refused is the demonstrative that
# hands off to another pronoun -- "And these are those who have part in the
# first resurrection" -- or to a verb standing in for an act the verse never
# describes: "Now this was done because there were so many people", "This shall
# ye always do".
#
# "This is not all" is none of those. It is a turn in the argument rather than
# a subject, the teaching arrives immediately after it, and what "all" referred
# to is no part of what the reader takes away: "But this is not all; ye must
# pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your
# wilderness" is Alma 34:26, and it wants nothing from Alma 34:25. So a
# negated demonstrative is left alone.
#
# The General Conference card has refused paragraphs on this ground since it
# was written -- see `is_quotable_paragraph` -- and got the cleaner readings for
# it. This brings the two scripture cards up to the same standard.

# The exemption above lets every "it is" through, and half of them should not
# be. An "it" at the head of a verse is doing one of two opposite jobs, and
# which one decides whether the verse can be read cold at all.
#
# It is a placeholder when the verse goes on to say what it stands for: "It is
# better *that* one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and
# perish in unbelief", "it is expedient *that* an atonement should be made",
# "It is a fearful thing *to fall* into the hands of the living God", "It is
# better *to trust* in the Lord than to put confidence in man". None of those
# wants anything from outside, because the "it" is not about anything until the
# clause after it arrives -- which it does, in the same sentence.
#
# It is a pointer when the clause never comes. "But it is mockery before God,
# denying the mercies of Christ, and the power of his Holy Spirit, and putting
# trust in dead works" is Moroni 8:23, and the "it" is the baptising of little
# children, back in 8:22; the verse never says so. As a day's reading it calls
# something a mockery without ever saying what, which is how it was reported.
# Helaman 7:18 is the same word answering a question asked in Helaman 7:17 --
# "It is because you have hardened your hearts" -- and 2 Nephi 2:12's "it must
# needs have been created for a thing of naught" is the creation 2:11 spent
# itself describing.
#
# So the verse is read as far as its first full stop and the placeholder has to
# be filled inside it. Two constructions fill it without a complementiser and
# are named directly: "it shall come to pass", which is this book's way of
# saying that what follows happened and always carries what follows with it;
# and "it is written", where the "it" is the quotation that comes after the
# comma. A negated opener is left alone for the reason "this is not all" is --
# Alma 58:37's "But, behold, it mattereth not--we trust God will deliver us" is

# The same fault in adverb form, and the only one of these that word order
# decides.
#
# A verse that fronts "thus" is doing one of two opposite jobs with it. It is
# inferential when it means "and therefore", and then what follows is a
# conclusion that stands by itself: "And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of
# justice", "Thus all mankind were lost", "And thus we see that the gate of
# heaven is open unto all". The reader loses the derivation and keeps the
# point, and the point is the whole of the verse.
#
# It is a manner adverb when it means "in this way", and then it is a pointer
# with nothing in the verse to point at. Alma 46:14 is the clearest case there
# is: "For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the
# church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church." What they
# were called is "Christians", and it is in 46:13. The verse spends itself
# saying that a people were named something without ever saying what -- and it
# scored 7.3 doing it, high enough for the tier, because every word it uses is
# a gospel word. It was reported as broken.
#
# English marks which job the word is doing by inverting the subject and the
# verb. "Thus WERE all the true believers ... called", "Thus PASSED AWAY the
# thirty and second year", "Thus HATH the Lord dealt with me" -- against "thus
# WE SEE", "thus MERCY can satisfy", "Thus GOD has provided a means". So the
# test is for a finite verb standing where the subject belongs, which is also
# the shape this book keeps its bookkeeping in: "And thus ended the tenth year
# of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi."
#
# The exception is a speech attribution, where the inversion is idiom and the
# words the "thus" stands for arrive right after it. Around two in three of the
# fronted verbs are this, and they are among the best readings there are: "For
# thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which shall be done
# among them", "Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man should love his
# neighbor as himself", "For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set
# thee to be a light of the Gentiles". Those are filled by their own next
# clause and want nothing from the verse before.
#
# "So" fronts the same way and is refused on the same ground -- "So shall they
# fear the name of the Lord from the west", "Yea, so have I strived to preach
# the gospel". Its other uses are untouched, because none of them puts a verb
# in the subject's place: the degree correlative of "And so great was the faith
# of Enoch that he led the people of God" is answered by its own "that".
#
# Two verses look at first like the rule overreaching, and a reader ruled that
# it does not. Ether 12:31 -- "For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy
# disciples; for after they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst
# show thyself unto them in great power" -- points outward and then re-supplies
# the manner itself, in a clause restating the same act with the same subject,
# so it could be argued to fill its own "thus". It goes out anyway. Mosiah 28:4
# is the same shape and no closer call ("And thus did the Spirit of the Lord
# work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners" -- a reason for the
# mercy, not the manner of the working). Both are refused, and neither is a
# loss the pool feels.
#
# The verse the exemption is for is Doctrine and Covenants 137:7, "Thus came
# the voice of the Lord unto me, saying: All who have died without a knowledge
# of this gospel ... shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God" -- ruled a

# The third way out of itself, and the one that decides most verses: a

# Number is what matters here, and it took a while to see. A plural reads as

# did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the

# "he" is Christ -- which 2 Nephi 2:6 says and 2 Nephi 2:7 does not.
#

# above it describes: kneeling across the altar from Kathy in a holy temple of
# God. Alone on a card it asks the reader to remember a day it never names, and
# it was reported for it.
#
# This is the fault `unfilled_it` and `unfilled_thus` answer on the scripture
# cards, in the form a talk takes it. A talk is built out of stories, and the
# paragraph after a story refers back to it instead of retelling it -- which is
# why the fault is common enough here to be worth a rule of its own, and why
# the rule stays on this card. Scripture's "in that day" is the day of the
# Lord, and a reader supplies it.
#
# Two kinds of word are looked at, and not in the same way.
#
#   * A word that can mean *now* at a pulpit -- day, morning, moment, time --
#     points backwards only with "that" or "those". "This day" and "this
#     moment" are the ones the speaker is standing in, and want nothing from
#     any paragraph.
#   * A word for something already told -- experience, story, incident, visit
#     -- cannot mean now however it is introduced, so "this experience" and
#     "these stories" point back exactly as "that experience" does. Elder
#     Wakolo's "These stories are not about statistics. They are about souls"
#     is the plainest of them: read cold, there are no stories.
#
# What fills one is the paragraph saying which occasion it means, and it has
# three ways to:
#
#   * it named the occasion earlier in its own text, in either number -- "The
#     next morning their ward members gathered ... No one expected the bishop's
#     family to be at church that morning";
#   * a clause or an "of" follows and says which -- "on that day when a
#     priesthood leader felt impressed for us to visit a mother and a son",
#     "that moment of weakness";
#   * the occasion has not happened yet. "That day will be filled with joy for
#     the righteous", "That moment will come" -- what is still ahead is not
#     anything a speaker has already narrated, and the day of the Lord is a day
#     every reader can name.

    into a mail app, a message, a note, wherever the reader wants to put it.
    The page sends nothing anywhere, and nothing goes anywhere at all until the
    reader presses send in an app of their own.

    There are deliberately no app links above the field. Whether a `mailto:`
    or `sms:` link does anything at all is settled after the page is out of it,
    when the browser hands the address to the operating system, and if that
    handoff declines the page is told nothing: the link is pressed and it just
    sits there. `mailto:` is at least specified, and it was offered here for a
    while, but it was found dead on a current phone all the same -- a Pixel 9
    Pro, Brave, scripts off -- and markup cannot ask first, cannot be told it
    failed, and cannot fall back. `sms:` is worse: a prefilled body is custom
    only, never specification, Apple's own URL scheme reference says the
    address must not carry message text, and the platforms disagree over how to
    introduce it, Android reading `sms:?body=` and iOS `sms:&body=`, while
    `sms:?&body=` -- the spelling meant to satisfy both -- does nothing on a
    phone that satisfies neither.

    On a page that promises to work without scripts, a link that quietly fails
    is worse than one never offered, so the field is the whole of it: select,
    copy, paste, and certain of it on every phone there is.

    is offered the same thing twice.
