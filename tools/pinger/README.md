# Off-GitHub render pinger

A trigger for the deploy workflow that does not depend on GitHub's scheduler.

## Why this exists

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` asks GitHub to re-render the page three times a
day. GitHub runs a scheduled workflow when it has capacity and is free to skip
one outright. On 2026-08-27 the 08:10 UTC schedule fired eleven hours late; on
2026-08-28 it did not fire at all; on 2026-08-31 nothing scheduled ran at all
— both renders and the Monday refetch — and the page served Sunday's
readings until a dispatch was sent by hand. Three mornings in five.

Nobody with JavaScript noticed any of it. `assets/app.js` reads
`data-built-for` off `<body>`, compares it to the reader's own today, and
re-renders from `data/daily.json` when they disagree — and the calendar runs
to 2028. The readers this site is built for got the previous day all three
times, and the only reason it was caught is that someone looked.

## What it does and does not cover

It covers a **dropped or delayed schedule**, which is the whole of what went
wrong. `workflow_dispatch` is a queued API call, not best-effort scheduling.

It does **not** cover GitHub Actions being unavailable. A dispatch queues
behind the same outage a cron would have. This is a second way to *ask*, not a
second place to *run*. Nothing hosted outside GitHub can render this page,
because the renderer and the calendar live here.

It asks only when the answer is wrong: the worker reads the live page first
and stays quiet unless the day on it is stale. A morning where GitHub behaved
produces no dispatch, no run and no deploy.

## Setup

Two of these need an account only you have. About ten minutes.

### 1. A token that may dispatch the workflow

Create a **fine-grained** personal access token at
<https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>:

| Field             | Value                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Repository access | Only select repositories → `bell-kevin/verse` |
| Repository permissions | **Actions: Read and write** |

Nothing else. `Actions: write` is the whole of what a dispatch needs — this
token cannot read your code, push, or touch another repository.

> **This is how the backup dies quietly.** A fine-grained token expires, and an
> expired one answers `401` where a working one answers `204`. Either set the
> expiry to *No expiration*, or put the expiry date in a calendar. A pinger
> nobody has checked in a year is not a backup.

### 2. Deploy the worker

Cloudflare Workers' free tier covers this: cron triggers are included and this
uses one request a day against a 100,000/day allowance.

```sh
cd tools/pinger
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler deploy
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN   # paste the token from step 1
```

Deploy before setting the secret. `secret put` against a worker that does not
exist yet works, but it stops to ask whether to create one, and answering that
question is the only hard part of this. Deploying first means there is already
a worker to put the secret on. The worker picks the secret up as soon as it is
set; it does not need deploying again.

The first `deploy` on a new account asks you to pick a `workers.dev`
subdomain. Any name; it becomes part of the URL you test with below.

### 3. Confirm it works

`wrangler deploy` prints the worker's URL. Opening it runs the same check the
cron runs, by hand:

```sh
curl https://verse-render-pinger.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

On a good day, `200`:

```json
{ "ok": true, "today": "2026-08-28", "builtFor": "2026-08-28",
  "dispatched": false, "reason": "page is current" }
```

A bad token gives `503` and says so in `reason` — which is the point of the
endpoint. To watch the scheduled runs instead: `npx wrangler tail`.

To prove the dispatch path itself works rather than waiting for a bad morning,
temporarily set `TIMEZONE` in `wrangler.toml` to `Pacific/Kiritimati` and
redeploy: it is a day ahead, the page reads as stale, and you get a real
dispatch. Put it back afterwards.

## Timing

Five attempts, all landing on the same Denver day the page is built for:

| When (UTC)    | Denver (MDT / MST) | Who asks    |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 06:02 / 07:02 | 00:02              | `midnight.yml`, waiting on a runner since the evening |
| 08:10         | 02:10 / 01:10      | GitHub cron |
| 14:40         | 08:40 / 07:40      | GitHub cron |
| 16:25         | 10:25 / 09:25      | this worker |
| 20:35         | 14:35 / 13:35      | GitHub cron |

The worker goes fourth, on purpose: it is the one that asks once GitHub has had
three chances and taken none, and it asks hours before GitHub's own last
attempt would.

That last GitHub attempt sits behind the worker for the morning the worker is
the thing that is broken. An expired token answers `401` and dispatches
nothing, and it does that quietly — so the last word of the day belongs to a
scheduler that needs no credential anyone has to remember to renew.

`TIMEZONE` in `wrangler.toml` must match `--timezone` in
`tools/build_daily.py` (`America/Denver`). If they drift apart, the worker
reads a correct page as stale every night between the two midnights and
dispatches a pointless render daily.

## If you would rather not run a worker

Any scheduler that can send an authenticated POST will do — [cron-job.org] is
free and needs no code:

* URL `https://api.github.com/repos/bell-kevin/verse/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/dispatches`
* Method `POST`, body `{"ref":"main"}`
* Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `Accept: application/vnd.github+json`,
  `User-Agent: verse-render-pinger`, `Content-Type: application/json`

The trade is that it fires unconditionally, so you get a render and a deploy
every day whether or not one was needed. Harmless — `--render-only` writes the
same bytes and the commit step exits on `Nothing changed` — but it is a third
scheduled render rather than a thing that speaks up only when something broke,
and a daily green run is a poor place to notice a red one.
